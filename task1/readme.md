**Task 1: Student Score Prediction**

This task focuses on building a regression model to predict students' exam scores based on the number of study hours and related performance factors. The task demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of a simple machine learning model.

**Description**

Dataset used: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)

Goal: Build a predictive model for students’ exam scores

Main steps:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct basic data visualization and explore correlations

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Visualize predictions vs true values

**Tools & Libraries**

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

**Covered Topics**

Regression

Evaluation Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)
