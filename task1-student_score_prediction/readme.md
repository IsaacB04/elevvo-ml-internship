**Task 1: Student Score Prediction**

This task focuses on building a regression model to predict students' exam scores based on the number of study hours and related performance factors. The task demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of a simple machine learning model.

**Description**

Dataset used: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)
Goal: Build a predictive model for students’ exam scores
Main steps:
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct basic data visualization and explore correlations
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Visualize predictions vs true values

**Tools & Libraries**

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

**Covered Topics**

- Regression
- Evaluation Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)
- Data Visualization
